# Hey There, 
### In this Folder you will Find

1. The two .csv files used for data analysis </br>
   a) casualties_n_cases.csv </br>
   b) vaccinated.csv
2. One .pbix file which I used to visualize my findings
3. A .txt file explaining how to import data using Command Line

And checkout, [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/) (NO, *not sponsored,* though I wish it did) </br> that's where I got this data from, 
they have a huge data repository which might come handy in your projects.
