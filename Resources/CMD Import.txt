Importing large datasets to MySQL Workbench using Command Line

Step 1. 
	Open MySQL Workbench
	Create a new Database (say Covid_Impact) to store the tables you'll import.
	Create the table with matching data types of csv file, usually with INT and CHAR datatypes only (without the data) in the database you just created using Workbench.

Step 2. 
	Open the terminal or Command Prompt (Go to windows -> Search for cmd)

Step 3. 
	We'll now connect with MySQL database in command line prompt. Follow the steps below:
	a. Copy the path of your MySQL bin directory in your computer. (Normally it is under c drive program files).
	b. The bin directory of MySQL Server is generally in this path - C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
	c. Now, in the Command Line prompt, type 
	   	cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin 
	   and press enter.

Step 4. 
	Connect to the MySQL database using the following command in command Prompt: mysql -u root -p
		(Please replace "root" with your user name that you must have configured while installing MySQL server)
	Press enter, it will ask for the password, give your MySQL password

Step 5. 
	If you are successfully logged to mysql, then set the global variables by using below command so that data can be imported from local computer folder.
	SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;


It will return the following:
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)


Step 6. 
	Quit current server connection:

It will return the following:
mysql> quit
Bye


Step 7. 
	Load the file from CSV file to the MySQL database. In order to do this, please follow the commands:
	(We'll connect with the MySQL server again with the local-infile system variable. 
	 This basically means you want to upload data into a database table from your local machine)

	mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
	(give password)

	Show Databases;

	USE Covid_Impact;
	(makes the database that you had created in step 1 as default schema to use for the next sql scripts)



Step 8. 
	The next step is to load the data from local case study folder into the vaccinated table in Covid_Impact Database)
	LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\Users\Shivam Tyagi\Downloads\vaccinated.csv' INTO TABLE Covid_Impact FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;


NOTE(VERY IMP)- Make sure to replace single backward (\) slash in the path with double back slashes (\\)



You're all set now!
